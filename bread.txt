**Ingredients:**
- 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
- 1 1/4 cups warm water (about 110째F/43째C)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (optional, for flavor)

**Instructions:**

1. **Activate the Yeast:**
   - In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.

3. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   - Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour in the activated yeast mixture and olive oil (if using). Stir until the dough starts to come together.

4. **Knead the Dough:**
   - Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.

5. **First Rise:**
   - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size.

6. **Shape the Dough:**
   - Punch down the risen dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Shape it into a loaf.

7. **Second Rise:**
   - Place the shaped dough into a greased loaf pan. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.

8. **Preheat and Bake:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C). Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

9. **Cool:**
   - Allow the bread to cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. **Enjoy:**
    - Slice and enjoy your homemade bread! It's great with butter, jam, or your favorite spreads.
